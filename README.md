## Installation

This code requires Python 3.6 and above, to run and a Python IDE of your choice. Click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python.

To manage the databases, DB Browser for SQLite was used. Click [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/), if you want to download it.

This program requires the usage of the ```BeautifulSoup``` and the ```requests``` library.

```BeautifulSoup``` and ```requests``` can be installed by entering the following commands in your terminal/command line respectively:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install requests
```
```BeautifulSoup``` supports a variety of third-party parsers, like ```lxml```. To install ```lxml```, enter the following command in your terminal/command line:

```bash
pip install lxml
```

## How It Works

### Libraries Used

First and foremost, the following libraries need to be imported:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import sqlite3
```

* ```BeautifulSoup```: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching and modifying the parse tree.
* ```requests```: Allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).
* ```sqlite3```: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process. The database is accessible using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.

### Database

The SQL table contains 4 attributes (columns):

The database and table (MovieList) have been created in the Python code:

```python
conn = sqlite3.connect('imdbList.db')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MovieList')

cur.execute('''
CREATE TABLE MovieList (ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                        MovieName VARCHAR(200),
                        Year YEAR,
                        Rating DEC(2,1))''')
```

### Scraping

```python
url = "https://www.imdb.com/chart/top"
resp = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.text, features= 'lxml')
```
The URL for containing the top 250 movies has been saved as a string. ```request.get``` is used to request data from the server. ```resp``` acts as a file handle, and is passed into the ```BeautifulSoup``` constructor. ```soup``` contains the source code of the website.

```python
tbody = soup.find('tbody', class_='lister-list')
```
